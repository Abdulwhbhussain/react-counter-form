# React Counter & Form

A small React app demonstrating state management with a simple counter and a controlled form.

Built with Vite + React, this example is ideal for beginners learning hooks and form handling.

---

## Features

- Counter with increment, decrement, and reset controls.
- Simple controlled form handling with Name and Email fields.
- Shows submission details locally (no backend required).

---

cd react-counter-form
```

2. Install dependencies:

## Usage

Start the local dev server:

npm run dev
```

Open your browser at the printed URL (usually `http://localhost:5173` by default) and interact with the app.

### What to try
